    "## Model evaluation\n",
    "In this task we will take a look at the evaluation of a classifier. To do this we give you some functions that allow you to train a classifier with PyTorch. PyTorch is a bit more advanced than scikit-learn and needs you to do more of the busy work yourself.\n",
    "On the other hand it gives you the freedom to manually create your own training schemes and network configurations. Together with tensorflow it is the defacto industry standart when it comes to neural network training.\n",
    "For this task it's not really necessary to understand the PyTorch code but if you're interested in learning PyTorch try to follow along by reading the comments. Don't worry, it's ok if you don't understand everything. Just be aware that for our purpose torch.tensor behaves mostly like numpy.array which you should be familiar with by now.\n",
